## Title: Multiple Linear Regression Model to Predict Electricity Demand of Five Cities in Spain

### Abstract
 The ability to estimate of electricity demand pattern allows electric grid operator design the market that serves the
interest of people. This report models multi-linear and tree based regression using temporal and weather attributes.
We performed the analysis for five cities in Spain over the four-year time period (2015-2018) all in hourly resolution.
Assessment of five reduction methods yielded the p-value reduced model being the preferred from the MLR analysis
for all the five cities. However, the RMSE and mean error (predicted vs actual) values were found to be double those
of the tree regression model approach (91.2 MWH and 3.58% VS 51.7 MWH and 1.66%, respectively). Given the same
condition, Tree model is preferred over MLR model. As a part of Tree analysis, we calculated the optimal number of
branches in random forest model by looking at mean errors of accuracy threshold of 95%, which in turn significantly
limited over fitting of the model. With reference to the Tree analysis importance plots, the three temporal variables
coupled with daytime time band dummy variable have the greatest influence on energy demand prediction.
